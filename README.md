"Building and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Handwritten Digit Recognition using the MNIST Dataset"
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The code begins by installing and importing necessary libraries, including Keras for building the neural network and NumPy for array manipulations.
The MNIST dataset is loaded using Keras, containing images of handwritten digits (0 to 9).
The dataset is then visualized, and some basic information about its shape is displayed.

Data Preprocessing:
The labels (y_train and y_test) are converted to categorical format using one-hot encoding.
The pixel values of the images are normalized to the range [0, 1].

Neural Network Model Construction:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is created using Keras Sequential API.
The model consists of convolutional layers with max-pooling, a flattening layer, and dense layers.
The final layer uses softmax activation for multi-class classification.

Model Compilation:
The model is compiled using the categorical crossentropy loss function, RMSprop optimizer, and accuracy as the metric.

Model Training:
The model is trained on the training data (x_train and y_cat_train) for a specified number of epochs.

Model Evaluation:
The trained model is evaluated on the test data (x_test and y_cat_test) using the evaluate method.
The accuracy and loss on the test set are displayed.
Prediction and Classification Report:

Predictions are made on the test set using the trained model.
The classification report is generated using scikit-learn's classification_report and printed.
The overall goal of the code is to demonstrate the process of building, training, and evaluating a CNN for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, and a classification report provides additional insights into its classification performance.
